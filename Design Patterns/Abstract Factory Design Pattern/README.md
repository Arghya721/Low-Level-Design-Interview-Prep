# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Definition
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is an extension of the Factory Design Pattern. While the regular Factory Pattern focuses on creating objects of a single type (i.e., one product), the Abstract Factory Pattern goes a step further — it provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to create multiple related objects that should be used together.

## Purpose
- **Family of Related Objects**: Creates families of related products that are designed to work together
- **Platform Independence**: Allows switching between different families of products without changing client code
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensures that products from the same family are used together
- **Encapsulation of Product Creation**: Hides the creation logic and dependencies between related objects
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new product families without modifying existing code

## Where to Use
- **Cross-Platform UI Development**: Creating platform-specific UI components (Windows, Mac, Linux widgets)
- **Database Abstraction**: Creating different database connection factories (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- **Theme Management**: Creating different UI themes with related components (Dark theme, Light theme)
- **Vehicle Manufacturing**: Creating families of vehicles (Luxury vehicles, Economy vehicles, Electric vehicles)
- **Game Development**: Creating related game objects (Medieval theme, Sci-fi theme, Fantasy theme)
- **Document Processing**: Creating related document handlers (PDF family, Office family, Text family)
- **E-commerce Systems**: Creating payment processing families (Credit card processors, Digital wallet processors)

## Implementation Structure

### Components
1. **Abstract Product** (`Vehicle`): Common interface for all products in a family
2. **Concrete Products** (`BMW`, `Mercedes`, `Suzuki`, `Hyundai`): Specific implementations of products
3. **Abstract Factory** (`VehicleFactory`): Interface for creating families of related products
4. **Concrete Factories** (`LuxuryVehicle`, `OrdinaryVehicle`): Implement abstract factory to create specific product families
5. **Client** (`Main`): Uses abstract factory and products through their interfaces

### Class Diagram
```
Vehicle (Abstract Product)
    ↑
    ├── BMW (ConcreteProduct - Luxury)
    ├── Mercedes (ConcreteProduct - Luxury)
    ├── Suzuki (ConcreteProduct - Ordinary)
    └── Hyundai (ConcreteProduct - Ordinary)

VehicleFactory (Abstract Factory)
    ↑
    ├── LuxuryVehicle (ConcreteFactory)
    └── OrdinaryVehicle (ConcreteFactory)

Client → VehicleFactory → Vehicle
```

## Abstract Factory vs Factory Pattern

### Factory Pattern
- Creates objects of a **single product type**
- One factory class handles one product hierarchy
- Simple conditional logic (switch/if statements)
- Example: ShapeFactory creates Circle, Square, Triangle

### Abstract Factory Pattern
- Creates **families of related products**
- Multiple factory classes, each handling a product family
- Each factory ensures products work together
- Example: LuxuryVehicleFactory creates BMW, Mercedes; OrdinaryVehicleFactory creates Suzuki, Hyundai

## Benefits
- **Product Family Consistency**: Ensures related products are used together
- **Easy Product Family Switching**: Change entire product family by switching factory
- **Isolation of Concrete Classes**: Client code doesn't depend on specific product classes
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: Add new product families without modifying existing code
- **Platform Independence**: Different factories can provide platform-specific implementations

## Drawbacks
- **Increased Complexity**: More interfaces and classes compared to simple Factory pattern
- **Difficult to Extend Product Types**: Adding new product types requires modifying all factory interfaces
- **Code Overhead**: More abstract layers may be unnecessary for simple applications
- **Learning Curve**: More complex pattern requiring good understanding of inheritance and interfaces

## Best Practices
- Use when you need to create families of related objects
- Ensure all products from a factory are designed to work together
- Keep product families cohesive and related
- Consider using with Builder pattern for complex product construction
- Document the relationships between products in each family

## Real-world Applications
- **Java Swing**: Different Look-and-Feel factories create related UI components
- **JDBC**: Different database vendors provide factories for their specific implementations
- **Spring Framework**: Different profile-based factories for environment-specific beans
- **Game Engines**: Different theme factories create related sprites, sounds, and effects
- **Operating Systems**: Different OS factories create OS-specific file systems, threads, and processes
