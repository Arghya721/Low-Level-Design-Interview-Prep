# Low-Level Design Interview Preparation

A comprehensive repository containing popular Design Patterns, SOLID principles, and common Low-Level Design (LLD) problems implemented in both Java and Golang. This repository is specifically designed for interview preparation and learning software design principles.

## 🎯 What This Repository Contains

### 🏗️ Design Patterns
Learn and practice essential design patterns with complete implementations:

- **Abstract Factory Pattern** - Creating families of related objects
- **Builder Pattern** - Step-by-step object construction
- **Decorator Pattern** - Adding behavior dynamically
- **Factory Pattern** - Object creation without specifying exact classes
- **Observer Pattern** - Event-driven communication between objects
- **Singleton Pattern** - Ensuring single instance of a class
- **Strategy Pattern** - Interchangeable algorithms

### 🔧 SOLID Principles
Master the fundamental principles of object-oriented design:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - One class, one responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Subtypes are substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Many specific interfaces over one general interface
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 🎮 Common LLD Problems
Practice with real-world system design problems:

- **Food Delivery System** - Restaurant management, order processing, delivery
- **LRU Cache** - Least Recently Used cache implementation
- **Parking Lot System** - Vehicle parking with different spot types
- **Snakes and Ladders** - Board game with jumpers and dice
- **Tic Tac Toe** - Classic game with game state management
- **Vending Machine** - Product dispensing with payment processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### For Java Examples:
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher (for some examples)

#### For Golang Examples:
- Go 1.19 or higher

### Running Examples

#### Java Examples:
```bash
# Navigate to specific pattern/problem
cd "Design Patterns/Factory Design Pattern/Java"

# run
java Main.java
```

#### Golang Examples:
```bash
# Navigate to specific pattern/problem
cd "Design Patterns/Factory Design Pattern/Golang"

# run
go run main.go
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### 1. Start with SOLID Principles
Begin with the foundational principles that guide good software design:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### 2. Learn Design Patterns
Move to design patterns that solve common design problems:
- **Creational Patterns**: Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton
- **Structural Patterns**: Decorator
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy

### 3. Practice with LLD Problems
Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios:
- Start with simpler problems like Tic Tac Toe
- Progress to complex systems like Food Delivery
- Focus on object modeling and interaction design

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

### Design Patterns
- **When to use** each pattern
- **Implementation details** in multiple languages
- **Real-world applications** and examples
- **Benefits and drawbacks** of each pattern

### SOLID Principles
- **Practical examples** of violations and solutions
- **Code refactoring** techniques
- **Best practices** for maintainable code
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them

### System Design
- **Object modeling** and relationships
- **Class responsibility** assignment
- **Interface design** and abstraction
- **Error handling** and edge cases

## 🔍 Interview Tips

### For Design Pattern Questions:
- Understand the **problem** each pattern solves
- Know **when to use** vs. when not to use
- Be able to **implement** from scratch
- Explain **trade-offs** and alternatives

### For SOLID Principle Questions:
- Identify **violations** in given code
- Suggest **refactoring** approaches
- Explain **benefits** of following principles
- Provide **real-world examples**

### For LLD Problem Questions:
- Start with **core entities** and their relationships
- Design **clean interfaces** and abstractions
- Consider **scalability** and extensibility
- Handle **edge cases** and error scenarios
